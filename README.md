# NBA-Trends

In this project, I'll analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explore possible associations.

This data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the [Complete History Of The NBA](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#warriors) and contains the original, unmodified data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.

You can read more about the data and how it’s being used by 538 [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo). For this project I’ve limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, `point_diff`, the difference between `pts` and `opp_pts`).
